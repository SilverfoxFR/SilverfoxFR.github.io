I'm planning on replacing this weirdass, AI-generated JS engine with my own C engine... Which will probably be even crappier at first.
Anyways, be certain to see a "Test" game appear outta nowhere, with 3D stuff appearing in it- Just goofing around with stuff and parameters (and maybe shaders + 3D animation)

The created engine's purpose is to be totally independant- So YES the renders and the general performance may or may not be poor or even nonexistant at first :,)
Oh and credit me if you're gonna use my engine or whatever people say

Adventure Mini â€” Demo pack for Modular Engine (Local)
----------------------------------------------------

Drop this zip into the Modular Engine (Local) via "Install Pack (.zip)".

What it does:
- Simple tile map (border + rooms)
- Player movement (arrow keys)
- Items: key, sword, chalice
- Dragon guarding chalice
- Bats that roam arbitrarily and will still move when player offscreen
- Simple pickups and collisions

Use this as a starting point to:
- Add audio when picking up items
- Replace procedural sprites with art files (update FileContent.json)
- Expand AI or map size, or add multiple levels
